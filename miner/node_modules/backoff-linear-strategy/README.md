Linear strategy for [backoff](https://github.com/MathieuTurcotte/node-backoff).



## Installation

```bash
$ npm install backoff-linear-strategy
```



## Usage

Construct a lineary backoff with a initial delay of 50ms and a
maximum delay of 500ms which will fail after 10 retries.

```js
var LinearBackoffStrategy = require('backoff-linear-strategy'),
    Backoff = require('backoff/lib/backoff');

var linear = new Backoff(new LinearBackoffStrategy({
    initialDelay: 50,
    maxDelay: 500
}));

linear.failAfter(10);

linear.on('backoff', function (number, delay) {
    console.log(number + ' ' + delay + 'ms');
});

linear.on('ready', function (number, delay) {
    linear.backoff();
});

linear.on('fail', function (number, delay) {
    console.log('fail');
});

linear.backoff();
```

The previous example will print the following.

```sh
0 50ms
0 100ms
1 150ms
2 200ms
3 250ms
4 300ms
5 350ms
6 400ms
7 450ms
8 500ms
9 500ms
fail
```



## Tests

```bash
$ npm test
```
